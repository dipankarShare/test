## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

The credit card statement feature uses the same PDF parsing libraries:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:

- `PyPDF2`: PDF file handling
- `pdfplumber`: Advanced PDF text extraction
- `tabula-py`: Table extraction from PDFs

### 2. Configure Credit Card Provider

The system automatically detects credit card providers based on statement content. Supported providers include:

- **Chase**: `chase_credit`
- **Citi**: `citi_credit`
- **FSU Credit Union**: `fsu_credit_union`
- **American Express**: `amex_credit`
- **Discover**: `discover_credit`
- **Generic**: `generic_credit_card`

### 3. Import Credit Card Statement

#### Option A: PDF Auto-Parsing (Recommended)

1. Navigate to **Credit Cards** ‚Üí **Statement Import** in the sidebar
2. Select your credit card provider from the dropdown
3. Upload your PDF statement
4. Click **Parse Statement** to automatically extract data
5. Review and adjust the extracted information
6. Click **Import Statement** to save

#### Option B: Manual Entry

1. Select your credit card provider
2. Manually enter statement information
3. Add transactions one by one
4. Click **Import Statement** to save

## Credit Card Statement Format Support

The system automatically detects and extracts:

### Statement Summary

- Statement closing date
- Payment due date
- Previous statement balance
- Current statement balance
- Minimum payment amount
- Credit limit and available credit

### Transaction Data

- Transaction dates
- Merchant names and descriptions
- Transaction amounts

## Customizing Credit Card Parsing

### Adding New Credit Card Providers

To add support for a new credit card provider:

1. **Create Provider Configuration**:

```json
{
  "new_provider": {
    "name": "New Credit Card Provider",
    "type": "credit_card",
    "keywords": ["provider", "credit", "card"],
    "patterns": {
      "statement_date": {
        "pattern": "Statement Date[:\\s]*(\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{1,2}[/-]\\d{2,4})",
        "description": "Statement date pattern"
      },
      "ending_balance": {
        "pattern": "New Balance[:\\s]*\\$?([-\\d,]+\\.?\\d*)",
        "description": "Current balance pattern"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Add to `credit_card_formats.json`**:
   - Copy the configuration to the appropriate file
   - Test with sample statements
   - Adjust patterns as needed

### Pattern Customization

Common patterns for credit card statements:

```python
# Date patterns
r'Statement Date[:\s]*(\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4})'
r'Closing Date[:\s]*(\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4})'

# Balance patterns
r'Previous Balance[:\s]*\$?([-\d,]+\\.?\d*)'
r'New Balance[:\s]*\$?([\d,]+\\.?\d*)'
r'Minimum Payment[:\s]*\$?([\d,]+\\.?\d*)'

# Transaction section detection
r'Date|Description|Amount|Category|Reference'
```

## Testing Credit Card Parsing

Use the included test script to verify parsing works with your statements:

```bash
python test_credit_card_parsing.py
```

This script will:

1. Extract text from your credit card PDF
2. Test various parsing patterns
3. Show what data was found
4. Provide recommendations for customization

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Credit Card Account

  provider: "chase_credit",
  account_number: "****1234",
  credit_limit: 15000,
};

const response = await fetch("/credit-card-accounts", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(accountData),
});
```

### Importing a Credit Card Statement

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", pdfFile);
formData.append(
  "statement",
  JSON.stringify({
    credit_card_account_id: 1,
    statement_date: "2024-01-31",
    previous_balance: 1250.5,
    current_balance: 1450.75,
    minimum_payment: 35.0,
    payment_due_date: "2024-02-25",
  })
);

const response = await fetch("/credit-card-statements/1", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pattern Not Matching**: Check the regex patterns in your provider configuration
2. **Missing Data**: Verify the statement format matches the expected layout
3. **Date Format Issues**: Ensure date patterns match your statement format
4. **Amount Parsing**: Check for currency symbols and formatting differences

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Set logging level to DEBUG in your configuration
2. **Test Individual Patterns**: Use regex testing tools to verify patterns
3. **Sample Statement Analysis**: Examine the extracted text to identify patterns
4. **Provider Detection**: Check if the correct provider is being auto-detected

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for credit card statement management:

- **Automatic Categorization**: AI-powered transaction categorization
- **Spending Analytics**: Detailed spending analysis and trends
- **Payment Reminders**: Due date notifications and payment tracking
- **Rewards Tracking**: Credit card rewards and cashback tracking
- **Statement Comparison**: Month-over-month statement analysis
- **Export Options**: CSV, Excel, and PDF export capabilities

## Support

For issues with credit card statement parsing:

1. Check the provider configuration matches your statement format
2. Verify the PDF is text-based (not image-only)
3. Test with the generic credit card configuration
4. Review the extracted text for pattern matching opportunities
5. Create a custom provider configuration if needed

The credit card statement feature provides a robust foundation for managing multiple credit card accounts with automatic data extraction and flexible configuration options.
